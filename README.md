# Bounce Project Brief
To develop a video game application with Unity, must be portable to Android.

### Play now
This game can be ran on a browser that supports WebGL. You can play the game [here](http://alexsikorski.net/bounce.html).

### Prerequisites
* Unity
* C#

## Features
The player starts with two bounces represented by arrows in the user interface. The player gains bounces on collision with green circles. Every 1000 points a triangle spawns that follows the player and shoots projectiles that kill the player.
Like Neon Rush, the high score is saved. The player has to survive for as long as possible - the circles are randomly generated around the player constantly making the game infinite just like Neon Rush.
Unlike Neon Rush, this game has post-processing graphics and these effects change on collisions to render the game more immersive. It also contains custom sound effects generated by software called Bfxr. 

## Notes
Due to time restrictions the game could not be published on PlayStore, but the transition between WebGL and Android is possible and swift.
